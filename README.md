# Exploring Weather Trends Project

Summary
In this project, I will analyze local and global temperature data and compare the temperature trends where I live to overall global temperature trends.

Instructions
My goal is to create a visualization and prepare a write up describing the similarities and differences between global temperature trends and temperature trends in the closest big city to where I live. To do this, I followed the steps below:
Extracting the data from the database: I needed to export the temperature data for the world as well as for the closest big city to where I live from a list of cities and countries in the city_list table. To interact with the database, I wrote a SQL queries. 
A SQL query to extract the city level data and export to CSV.
A SQL query to extract the global data and export it to CSV.

Opening up the CSV: I opened up the CSV using Excel which a tool I feel most comfortable using. 
Creating a line charts: I Created a line charts that compares my city’s temperatures with the global temperatures. using plot the moving average rather than the yearly averages in order to smooth out the lines, making trends more observable.
Making observations: I made observations about the similarities and differences between the world averages and my city’s averages, as well as overall trends ,  and I answered some questions like: 
Is my city hotter or cooler on average compared to the global average? Has the difference been consistent over time?
“How do the changes in my city’s temperatures over time compare to the changes in the global average?” 
What does the overall trend look like? Is the world getting hotter or cooler? Has the trend been consistent over the last few hundred years?
